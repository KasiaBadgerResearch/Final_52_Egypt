# How has the share of communications and computer services, insurance and financial services, transport services, and travel services in Egypt’s total service imports evolved between 1977 and 2023?

## Abstract

Using World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) data, this study examines the evolution of service import composition in Egypt between 1977 and 2023. The analysis compares the share of communications and computer services, insurance and financial services, transport services, and travel services in total service imports, capturing long-term trends, sectoral shifts, and volatility in the economy. Over the period, all four service categories displayed high volatility. Communications and computer services as well as transport services were significantly higher than insurance and travel services at the start of the period in 1977. Long-term trends show that communications and computer services declined substantially, transport services increased slightly, travel services grew moderately, and insurance and financial services increased modestly. By 2023, transport services dominated total service imports, followed by travel services, communications and computer services, and finally insurance and financial services.

## 1. Question

How has the share of communications and computer services, insurance and financial services, transport services, and travel services in Egypt’s total service imports evolved between 1977 and 2023?

- **Communications and computer services proxy**: Percentage of total service imports
- **Insurance and financial services proxy**: Percentage of total service imports
- **Transport services proxy**: Percentage of total service imports
- **Travel services proxy**: Percentage of total service imports

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Communications and computer services (% of service imports, BoP)
  - Insurance and financial services (% of service imports, BoP)
  - Transport services (% of service imports, BoP)
  - Travel services (% of service imports, BoP)
- **Coverage**: Egypt, 1977–2023
- **Notes**: National-level data only

## 3. Method

1. Filtered the dataset for Egypt and selected the four service import indicators.
2. **Extracted relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, and Value.
3. Pivoted the dataset to create a side-by-side chronological comparison of all four service categories.
4. Produced a multi-line time series plot to visualize trends, relative magnitudes, and volatility over time.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Communications and computer services (% of service imports)**: Started high in 1977, decreased substantially over the period, ending as the third-largest category by 2023.
- **Transport services (% of service imports)**: Initially high, increased slightly over the period, becoming the largest service import category by 2023.
- **Travel services (% of service imports)**: Began lower than communications and transport, increased moderately over time, ranking second in 2023.
- **Insurance and financial services (% of service imports)**: Lowest initially, experienced slight growth, remaining the smallest share in 2023.
- **Comparison**: All four categories exhibited high volatility. Initially, communications and computer services and transport services dominated, but by 2023, transport services led, followed by travel services, communications and computer services, and insurance and financial services.

## 5. Interpretation

- The volatility of all categories indicates sensitivity to domestic and global economic conditions, policy shifts, and trade dynamics.
- The decline of communications and computer services’ share suggests relative stagnation or slower growth compared with other service sectors.
- The steady rise of transport and travel services highlights increasing trade connectivity, tourism, and logistics development in Egypt.
- The modest growth in insurance and financial services reflects gradual expansion of the financial sector, though it remains a minor component of imports.
- Overall, the shifting composition signals structural changes in Egypt’s service import economy and evolving sectoral priorities.

## 6. Limitations

- National aggregates may hide regional variations, sector-specific policies, or firm-level dynamics.
- WDI estimates may incorporate modeled data for earlier years, adding uncertainty.
- Descriptive analysis does not identify causal factors behind volatility or sectoral changes.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Examine correlations between service import shares and economic growth, trade liberalization, or sector-specific policies.
- Investigate the role of tourism, logistics infrastructure, and ICT development in shaping transport and travel import trends.
- Compare Egypt’s service import composition with other MENA countries to assess regional patterns and competitiveness.
- Analyze post-2023 trends to evaluate continuity, structural shifts, or emerging service sectors.
